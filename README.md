Install "packrat" and "shiny" packages in R, then run "install\_dependencies.R". This can be done using "Rscript install\_dependencies.R" in a terminal (may have to run a couple of times if the packrat initialization hangs) or line by line in RStudio (easier to monitor each package's installment).

Should be able to run the app after that.
